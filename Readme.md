### History
Folsense is just used to be a land in the middle of `Kingdom of Inici` (Povles origin country) and `Dachaigh` (Dhaoine origin country). Neither country want to take ownership to that land because of the problem it posses. Eventually, since neither country want's to take it, it becomes a famous place for travellers, especially for Warforged. And more travellers means more money, and eventually the small land that nobody wants, become a huge, prosperous independent city.
